## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This React app demonstrates a fully responsive UI built with Chakra UI. It features:
- A responsive navigation bar
- A responsive card layout with images, text, and buttons
- Breakpoint-based styling using Chakraâ€™s `SimpleGrid`, `Flex`, and `Box`

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start with `npm start`

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness
- On **mobile**, cards stack vertically and nav links stack.
- On **tablet**, cards show 2 in a row.
- On **desktop**, layout shows 3 cards and a full horizontal nav.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learnings
- Used Chakra's `SimpleGrid`, `Flex`, and `Stack` for layout.
- Applied responsive props like `columns={{ base: 1, md: 2 }}`.
- Learned to manage layout with Chakra without custom CSS or media queries.
